Variables :
     message = "Hello Python world!"
    print(message)

    output :  Hello Python world!

     Weâ€™ve added a variable named message. Every variable is
     connected to a value, which is the information associated
     with that variable. In this case the value is the "Hello Python
     world!" text.

     Adding a variable makes a little more work for the Python
     interpreter. When it processes the first line, it associates the
     variable message with the "Hello Python world!" text. When it
     reaches the second line, it prints the value associated with
     message to the screen.

     message = "Hello Python world!"
     print(message)
     message = "Hello Python Crash Course world!"
     print(message)

    output:  Hello Python world!
             Hello Python Crash Course world!

     You can change the value of a variable in your program at
     any time, and Python will always keep track of its current
     value.
